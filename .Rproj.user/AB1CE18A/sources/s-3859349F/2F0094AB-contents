## Question 1 [70 Points] Tuning Random Forests in Virtual Twins

```{r}
data = read.csv('Sepsis.csv')
n = dim(data)[1]
train.id = sample(, )

```

## Question 2 [30 Points] Second Step in Virtual Twins

The second step in a virtual twins model is to use a single tree model (CART) to describe the choice of the best treatment. Perform the following:
* Based on your optimal tuning parameter, fit the Virtual Twins model described in Question 1. Again, you should not use the `BEST` variable. 
* For each subject, obtain the predicted best treatment of the training data itself
* Treating the label of best treatment as the outcome, and fit a single tree model to predict it. Be careful which variables should be removed from this model fitting.
* Consider tuning the tree model using the cost-complexity tuning.
